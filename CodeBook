==== Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Programming Assignment ====
==== CODE BOOK ====

This Code Book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that the script performed to clean up the data.

The script cleans the data and creates two indipendent data frames with appropriate labels and descriptive variable names. 
Initially the script imports the test and training datasets (X_test.txt and X_train.txt) from the "UCI HAR Dataset" and joins them into a single data.frame, with columns named taken from the features.txt file.
Using grep() it is possible to select a subset of data. The partial string matching is used to find the columns that have "mean()" and "std()" in the name. These columns are then selected and they will form a new data frame.
Regarding column names from features.txt: the "()" and "-" symbols in the names are removed, and "mean" is replaced with "Mean" and "std" with "Std", for readability and consistency.

The script then reads the activity_labels.txt file from the "./UCI HAR Dataset" folder and assigns the names to a variable called activity.
Also for readability the script cleans the 6 activity names (second column of activity). All names are changed to lower cases (with tolower()). If the name has "_" inside, the "_" is removed and the consecutive letter is changed to upper case (with toupper()).

Before printing on file (allData.txt) the merged data.frame goodData with cleaned column names, the script converts subjects and activities to factors (with as.factor()).

The second part of the script extracts a subset from the merged data.frame. It creates a data.frame with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The data.frame is called averageData and it is printed on file (averageData.txt).
Before printing on file (averageData.txt) the new data.frame averageData, the script converts subjects and activities to factors (with as.factor()).

In the end the script removes from the workspace all variables and object of no further use. Only goodData and averageData data frames remain.
